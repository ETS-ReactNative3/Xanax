## About Xanax

Xanax is a web application framework. We don't trust php, php is dissonance, make headache, pain itself.

The problem with PHP is in the language. If you can't change the fundamentals, it doesn't solve the problem.

Who wants to use PHP? is we. because we don't like to learn new things. PHP is crap.

## Xanax ironclad rule

- We do not believe in PHP libraries. So we will use the library minimally.
- We do not believe in the PHP language. So we don't use a template engine.
- We will only provide minimal functionality. We believe that what you can do with PHP is limited.

**I really don’t like programming. I built this tool to program less so that I could just reuse code.

**I’m not a real programmer. I throw together things until it works then I move on. The real programmers will say “Yeah it works but you’re leaking memory everywhere. Perhaps we should fix that.” I’ll just restart Apache every 10 requests.
- Rasmus Lerdorf
